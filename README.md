# rechapter

To remove those pesky ordered chapters from your favorite releases, just put `rechapter.py` in the same directory as the mkv files, then run `python3 rechapter.py` and watch in awe as the OP/ED magically jump back in place.

# Dependencies
- Bash
- FFmpeg
- MkvToolNix
- Python3

# Caveats
- Only works with one each of video, audio, and sub tracks
- Uses bash, so some adjustment is required for Windows
- No fancy GUI

TODO: finish readme, consider Windows build
